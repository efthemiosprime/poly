# Introduction to PolyX

PolyX is a lightweight JavaScript library that brings powerful functional programming patterns to everyday JavaScript development. Derived from and inspired by many excellent functional programming libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem, PolyX provides a set of composable abstractions that make your code more reliable, readable, and maintainable.

**Important Note**: PolyX is primarily designed for learning purposes. While there are already many robust and battle-tested functional programming libraries available for JavaScript, I created PolyX as a personal journey to deeply understand both the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of these concepts. This library represents my hands-on exploration of functional programming patterns and how they can be applied to real-world projects. It's ideal for developers who, like me, want to learn by building and experimenting with these powerful abstractions rather than just using them as a black box.

## Why PolyX?

In modern JavaScript development, we often face challenges like:
- Handling potentially missing or null values
- Managing complex asynchronous operations
- Processing and validating data safely
- Composing operations in a clean, readable way

PolyX addresses these challenges through functional programming patterns that have been battle-tested in languages like Haskell, Scala, and PureScript, but with an API that feels natural to JavaScript developers.

## Core Features

- **Maybe Monad**: Safely handle potentially missing values without null checks
- **Either Monad**: Express operations that can either fail or succeed with useful error information
- **Task**: Manage asynchronous operations with powerful composition tools
- **Validation**: Collect and combine multiple validation errors
- **State**: Handle stateful computations in a pure, functional way

## Declarative vs Imperative

PolyX encourages a shift from imperative to declarative programming:

```javascript
// Imperative approach
function getUserName(userId) {
  const user = findUser(userId);
  if (user == null) {
    return "Guest";
  }
  return user.name || "Unnamed";
}

// Declarative approach with PolyX
function getUserName(userId) {
  return Maybe.fromNullable(findUser(userId))
    .map(user => user.name)
    .filter(name => name.length > 0)
    .getOrElse("Guest");
}
```

## Getting Started

PolyX is designed to be adopted incrementally. You can start with a single module like `Maybe` to handle null checks in your codebase, then gradually adopt other patterns as you become comfortable with the functional approach.
