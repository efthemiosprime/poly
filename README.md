# @efthemiosprime/poly

A lightweight functional programming library implementing various concepts from category theory.

## Purpose

Poly isn't just a utility libraryâ€”it's a learning journey through functional programming and category theory concepts. Designed for both practical application and educational exploration, Poly helps JavaScript developers:

- **Learn** fundamental category theory concepts through practical code examples
- **Explore** functional programming patterns in a real-world context
- **Apply** powerful abstractions to everyday JavaScript problems
- **Understand** how mathematical concepts translate into programming paradigms

## Installation

```bash
npm install @efthemiosprime/poly
```

## Core Concepts

Poly implements several key abstractions from category theory:

### Maybe
Handle nullable values without null checks

```javascript
// Instead of:
const name = user && user.profile && user.profile.name ? user.profile.name : 'Guest';

// Use Maybe:
import { Maybe } from '@efthemiosprime/poly';

const name = Maybe.of(user)
  .map(user => user.profile)
  .map(profile => profile.name)
  .getOrElse('Guest');
```

### Either
Express computations that might fail without throwing exceptions

```javascript
import { Either } from '@efthemiosprime/poly';

const divide = (a, b) => 
  b === 0 
    ? Either.Left(new Error('Division by zero'))
    : Either.Right(a / b);

divide(10, 2)
  .fold(
    error => console.error(error.message),
    result => console.log(`Result: ${result}`)
  );
```

### Task
Manage asynchronous operations with better composition than Promises

```javascript
import { Task } from '@efthemiosprime/poly';

const fetchUser = id => 
  Task((reject, resolve) => 
    fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
      .then(res => {
        if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');
        return res.json();
      })
      .then(resolve)
      .catch(reject)
  );

fetchUser(123)
  .map(user => user.name)
  .fork(
    error => console.error('Error:', error.message),
    name => console.log('User name:', name)
  );
```

## Learning Path

Poly is organized to help you learn functional programming concepts incrementally:

1. **Start with Maybe** - The simplest and most immediately useful monad
2. **Explore Either** - Learn error handling without exceptions
3. **Try Task** - Understand asynchronous operations in a functional way
4. **Study IO** - See how to handle side effects functionally
5. **Dive into Reader/State** - Explore dependency injection and state management
6. **Experiment with Lenses** - Learn immutable data manipulation techniques

## Examples

The library includes practical examples to help you understand how these concepts apply to real-world problems:

- Form validation using Applicative and Either
- API clients using Task and Reader
- State management using State monad
- DOM manipulation using IO monad

## Educational Resources

Poly comes with detailed documentation explaining not just how to use each abstraction, but also:

- The mathematical concepts behind each implementation
- Diagrams illustrating how data flows through these structures
- Interactive examples showing practical applications
- Comparisons with imperative solutions to the same problems
